## Debt in United States

Studies have been looking at medical debt as a social determinant of health. One looked at data in 2020 and found that the average medical debt in the US is $429. Unlike secured wealth (e.g., a mortgage), medical debt does not help people build wealth and can have long term consequences, such as impacting oneâ€™s credit score (Mendes De Leon & Griggs 2021, Levey, N 2022). Economic opportunity impacts things like intergenerational social mobility and health, which also suggests generational lasting impacts on health of medical debt (Katikireddi 2016).
	Our results show that marginalized populations have disproportionately higher burdens of medical debt. This includes marginalized communities like women and Black Americans, but also regions such as the south, where there is a higher percentage of individuals in poverty (Kurtzleben 2014). Furthermore, individuals aged between 36-65 also have a disproportionately higher burden of medical debt. This is also concerning given that these are individuals who are tasked with having to save for their future through retirement funds and investments, yet are struggling to maintain financial stability
